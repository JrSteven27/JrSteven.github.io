       <p>In the world of sports, basketball has quickly become one of the most watched sports in terms of popularity and viewership. In sports history, the numbers show that in the past, the viewership ratings for Women's basketball has been significantly less when compared to Men's basketball.  However, there has been a shift in the dynamic as the popularity of women's basketball has been on the rise. 
</p>
     </div>
     <div class=“col”>
        <p>The proof is in the numbers, as statistics show a major change in viewership in recent years. The 2023 Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) regular season games were watched by an average of 505 thousand viewers across ESPN Networks and CBS. This was a significant increase from the previous year and made the 2023 season the league’s highest-viewed regular season in recent years. </p>

<p> The WNBA has actively engaged with fans through various initiatives, including community outreach programs, fan events, and social media engagement. Building a strong community around the league fosters fan loyalty. This increased the attendance of games greatly as of recently. Many fans are going to these games now to support these female athletes they follow so heavily in the media. The league has produced iconic and marketable players, such as Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Maya Moore, and Breanna Stewart, who have become household names. These players contribute to the league's popularity by drawing in fans with their skill and charisma. </p>

<p>This increase in viewership is attributed to many reasons, any of which are associated with social media. There has been an increased amount of media coverage surrounding women's basketball in general, with some athletes profiting a lot off of their social media platforms. Social media spaces such as TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and others give these female athletes a chance to grow their popularity within the basketball community. </p>


<p>An example of a female athlete whose popularity has grown immensely in the basketball world is College Basketball star Angel Reese, who plays for the LSU Tigers Women's basketball team. According to On3, Angel Reese has an NIL (Student athlete compensation) value of $1.7 million, which is good enough to slot her at No. 7 in the prestigious NIL 100 list that ranks the 100 most highly valued student-athletes, which also includes male student-athletes. Several media reports suggest her net worth is $3 million as of 2023. </p>


<p>Reese, along with many other basketball stars, is helping grow the popularity of Women's basketball as many popular sports media platforms such as ESPN, BallisLife, Overtime, and others, cover and update their followers frequently on Womens basketball news. Media coverage of women’s sports has nearly tripled, according to a recent report by Wasserman. The average share of sports media coverage across broadcasts, streaming, social media, and digital publications has risen to 15% for 2022, based on their report. In comparison to previous studies of viewership ratings, reported coverage averages peaked at only 5.7% for the popular sports news show ESPN’s SportsCenter, at 5.1% for TV news through 2019, and even less when looking at the amount of coverage through social media. </p>

<p>Fans in the sports world of basketball are interacting with Women's basketball more than ever in today's day and age, and it is helping this area of the sport grow. Women’s collegiate and professional sports combined for a total of 22,065 hours of streamed coverage in 2022, a 5,124 hours increase from 2021. It is impressive to see the major success for this area of Womens sports, as in our history it has often been frowned upon. </p>


<p>“The growth in popularity in women’s basketball is something that is so beautiful to see, and I know the girls feel the love,” shared Steven Gilbert, the Syracuse Women's Basketball Video Coordinator/Coach. “These girls work so hard to perfect their craft in this sport that is very tedious and takes a toll on their bodies as well as their mental health. But I know it (is) rewarding to them when they see the love from fans supporting them more than ever.” </p>


<p>Gilbert, as well as many other figures in the world of Womens basketball are loving the growth that is being made towards popularizing the sport. Fans are finally giving these female athletes the credit they deserve, and it is paying off in ways it has never before. Womens basketball is looking to pave the way for the future of all Women's Sports and all the young female athletes looking to make careers in the sports world. </p>
